a minecraft server admin frontend, to be accessed via HTTP and written using nodeJS.

It cant do much at the moment, and probably never will.
Right now, it lets you:

* start and stop the minecraft server
* view server output
* send arbitrary commands to the server console

prerequisites:

* nodeJS (>=0.2.0)

setup:

* checkout/clone to local directory
* create config.js (see config.js.example)
* start main.js
* connect using <browser of your choice> to http://[your host]:[config.httpPort]/[config.adminkey]
