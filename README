a minecraft server admin frontend, to be accessed via HTTP and written using nodeJS.

It cant do much at the moment, and probably never will.
Right now, it's kind of a ssh replacement for people who
a) dont want their server to die if/when the tty dies and
b) dont like screen

setup:

* edit config.js
* start main.js
* connect using <browser of your choice>
