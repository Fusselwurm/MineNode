A minecraft server frontend, to be accessed via HTTP and written using nodeJS.

It cant do much at the moment, and probably never will.
Right now, it lets you:

* start and stop the minecraft server
* view server output
* view server properties
* send arbitrary commands to the server - also from in-game (prefix "!")
* configure different users, using three roles: "admin", "player" and "visitor", the latter ones having less rights
* chat between web-frontend and players

prerequisites:

* nodeJS (>=0.2.0)

setup:

* checkout/clone to local directory
* create config.js (see config.js.example)
* start main.js

use:

* connect using <browser of your choice> to http://[your host]:[config.httpPort]/[username]
* send commands/view output directly on console (try 'help')
